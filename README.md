# LegendTD2m Sidekick

This repository walks through setting up a server that can successfully run the OHDSI LegendT2dm study. It requires a succesffully configured database instance.

See, for example, the [OHDSI Test Data repository](https://github.com/erikwestlund/ohdsi-test-data) which provides all necessary steps to configure a PostgreSQL instance on Ubuntu 22.04 and load test data from Eunomia.
